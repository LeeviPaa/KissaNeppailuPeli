Thank you for purchasing the Console Button Package. This asset will be updated for more consoles and button icons!

In this package, I have included:

-PlayStation Button Icons (.png, .PSD)
-Xbox Button Icons (.png, .PSD)
-more coming soon!
-PLEASE READ IMPORTANT INFO DOWN BELOW

*.PSD referring to photoshop file in case of user customization

If you feel the need to request a certain console's button icons or have other questions or comments:

-visit kunalthedev.wixsite.com/buttons to email me using the email form

If you have made your own improvements or variations to the buttons, and you would like to share with others
send me the directory like a github or dropbox, etc. and I will make it available to everyone in the next update.

****** IMPORTANT INFO ******
I have included 200x200 icons and photoshop files as well as High Resolution (~2000x2000px)
icons and photoshop files

In unity depending on what resolution you are working in, you may need a higher or lower res. icon

In case the 200x200 icons do not work out for you:

Create a duplicate of the high-resolution folder and rename to your preferred resolution;
then go into the photoshop file for all the icons you want to resize:
"image" tab at the top >> "Image Size" >> Then type in desired width and height >> 1000 ppi >> save and export

If you do not own photoshop, contact me and I will release the desired resolution for you for each button set for the next update
If you feel that I should include a certain resolution, contact me and I will release the desired resolution as fast as I can
